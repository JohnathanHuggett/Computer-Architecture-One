Explain how the CPU provides concurrency: \* it allows different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome.

Describe assembly language and machine language:
_ assembly is plain-text and (somewhat) human read-able source code that mostly has a direct 1:1 analog with machine instructions.
_ machine language is binary (1's and 0's) code that can be executed directly by the CPU.

Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without? \* because they have their own dedicated ram which increases their ability for parallel computing

Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
_ it speeds up the computing time from days or weeks to just a few hours in some cases
_ which allows programmers to make bigger and better neutral networks
